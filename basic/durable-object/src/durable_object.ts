	 * An optional function to check a request *on the Durable Object instance*. Generally, you should avoid this and override `preCheckFetch` instead, as this shortens response time for requests that fail as well as ensuring that you do not get billed for storage. However, you might need it if part of your criteria for whether a request should be rejected is based off something you store inside of the Durable Object's database.
	 *
	 * In most apps, you should only set this if `preCheckFetch` is already set, as `preCheckFetch` also decides on the ID of the Durable Object instance, and the default behaviour of always creating an instance with the same ID as the `engine_name` query parameter is usually undesirable.
	 *
	 * @returns A `Response` if the request should be blocked and not allowed to upgrade to a websocket, or `undefined` if the request can continue.
